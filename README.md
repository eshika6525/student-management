### 💼 **Project Title:**

**Student Management System (SQL Project)**

---

### 🧠 **Details of Solution Developed:**

I designed and implemented a **Student Management System** using SQL to demonstrate strong hands-on database and query development skills.

The project includes:

* Creation of a structured **schema** with multiple relational tables – `Students`, `Teachers`, `Classes`, `Parents`, `Subjects`, and `User Login`.
* Establishment of **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Key** relationships for data integrity.
* Insertion of sample data to simulate a real-world school environment.
* Implementation of advanced SQL queries using **JOINS**, **GROUP BY**, **CTEs**, and **WINDOW FUNCTIONS** to extract meaningful insights such as student counts, class rankings, and parent–child relationships.

This project demonstrates skills in **database design**, **data manipulation**, and **data analysis** through SQL.
